/*
 * Return one or more directory entries (struct dirent) to the caller. This is one of the most complex FUSE functions.
 * Required for essentially any filesystem, since it's what makes ls and a whole bunch of other things work.
 * The readdir function is somewhat like read, in that it starts at a given offset and returns results in a caller-supplied buffer.
 * However, the offset not a byte offset, and the results are a series of struct dirents rather than being uninterpreted bytes.
 * To make life easier, FUSE provides a "filler" function that will help you put things into the buffer.
 *
 * The general plan for a complete and correct readdir is:
 *
 * 1. Find the first directory entry following the given offset (see below).
 * 2. Optionally, create a struct stat that describes the file as for getattr (but FUSE only looks at st_ino and the file-type bits of st_mode).
 * 3. Call the filler function with arguments of buf, the null-terminated filename, the address of your struct stat
 *    (or NULL if you have none), and the offset of the next directory entry.
 * 4. If filler returns nonzero, or if there are no more files, return 0.
 * 5. Find the next file in the directory.
 * 6. Go back to step 2.
 * From FUSE's point of view, the offset is an uninterpreted off_t (i.e., an unsigned integer).
 * You provide an offset when you call filler, and it's possible that such an offset might come back to you as an argument later.
 * Typically, it's simply the byte offset (within your directory layout) of the directory entry, but it's really up to you.
 *
 * It's also important to note that readdir can return errors in a number of instances;
 * in particular it can return -EBADF if the file handle is invalid, or -ENOENT if you use the path argument and the path doesn't exist.
